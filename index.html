    <h2>Model History</h2>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <p>1968 was the year the name "Beetle" was given to the car. Volkswagen referred to the car as the "Type 1" until
      the 1968 model year. In Europe, it was marketed as the VW 1200/1300/1500 before adopting the "Beetle" name given
      to it by the public. German brochures used the name "Der Käfer" which means "The Beetle", on the front cover and
      inside for the first time in that year.</p>

    <p>Originally favored by students and other economy conscious consumers, the "Bug" quickly garnered attention for
      its price, fuel economy, durability and quality of manufacturing. VW advertising even demonstrated the water
      integrity of the little bug in the event you tried to drive it back to Germany. From 1968 to 2005, a pearl white
      1963 fabric sunroof Beetle with racing number "53" and red, white, and blue stripes named "Herbie" played a
      starring role in “The Love Bug” series of Disney comedy films.</p>

    <p>
      The popularity of these vehicles led to their place in history as the most produced car ever. The original
      Volkswagen ceased production when the Mexico plant stopped its production in the 1900's. Its reputation lives on
      in the new VW "Bugs". This 1968 2 door sedan has a streamlined body and a rear-mounted 4-cylinder, 53 hp,
      horizontally opposed air-cooled engine and had a factory price of $600.

      <p>The 1968 Volkswagen Beetle retained the classic shape that had already become an icon of the global automobile
        industry. Its rounded body with protruding fenders and separate round headlights was recognizable literally
        anywhere in the world. In 1968, the lights were slightly modernized, became more resistant to moisture, and the
        bumpers acquired slots that better dissipated the impact energy in small collisions.

    <div class="column text-column">
      <p>From the side, the Beetle looked even more handsome - its silhouette was smooth and harmonious. The high roof
        provided enough headroom even for tall passengers, and the short overhangs made the car very maneuverable in
        urban areas. Narrow roof pillars and large windows gave excellent visibility. Chrome moldings on the sides gave
        the car a sophisticated look.

    <div class="column text-column">
      <p>The rear of the Beetle is one of its most distinctive areas. It was where the engine was mounted, which made
        the rear end a little wider and heavier, contributing to good traction. The engine compartment lid opened
        downward, and behind it was the famous air-cooled four-cylinder opposition engine. On the hood lid there was a
        small ventilation grille and the VW badge.

    <div class="column text-column">
      <p>When opening the doors, the interior was greeted by minimalism, typical for the German design school of that
        time. The interior was simple, but well assembled: the metal dashboard was painted in the body color, there was
        a minimum of devices - only the most necessary. Comfortable steering wheel with a thin rim, large window
        lifters, seats with soft cushion and fabric upholstery made the trip quite comfortable.

    <div class="column text-column">
      <p>The front trunk of the Beetle was located under the hood. Despite its compact size, it was thought out to the
        last detail: a niche for a spare tire, a compartment for tools and luggage mounts. Thanks to the absence of a
        radiator (the engine is air-cooled), the space was used as efficiently as possible.

    <div class="column text-column">
      <p>The engine of the 1968 model had a capacity of 1.5 liters and developed about 53 hp. It was reliable, easy to
        repair and very economical. Air cooling eliminated the need to keep an eye on antifreeze, and the sound of the
        engine became a real trademark of “Beetle” - it was easily recognizable by ear. The car started well in cold,
        had a reliable 4-speed “mechanics” and unpretentious drove on any roads.

    <p>A high-quality 3D model of the legendary Volkswagen Beetle Fusca has been created with a carefully designed
        interior and fully textured surface. The model features a high level of detail: every part of the car, from the body to
        the interior, has been recreated with maximum accuracy, making it ideal for use in animation, film, video games,
        sports simulations, and educational projects.</p>

      <p>The model was developed with an emphasis on realism: high-resolution textures, accurate geometry, and detailed
        interior trim create an effect that is as close as possible to the original car. This project demonstrates the
        artistry of 3D content creation and serves as a versatile tool for both professional visualization and
        educational purposes.</p>

      <p>Every element of the model has been carefully thought out to ensure the most realistic reproduction of the car
        and create an impressive visual effect.</p>
